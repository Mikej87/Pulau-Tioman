              continues to enchant visitors with its warm beaches, lovely seas
              and lush greenery. Gazetted as a marine park, the immediate waters

              diving and snorkelling. Much of the island is covered by pristine
              rainforest, home to several endemic wildlife species and suitable

            <h2>The History of Tioman</h2>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          Once upon a time, a Chinese dragon princess was in love with a
          Singaporean prince. One day she decided to go to visit him. The
          powerful princess opened her large wings and started flying over the
          country, observing the people below her. After few hours she started
          passing above the sea but decided to continue even when she started to
          feel tired. Suddenly a storm started; exhausted she noticed a
          beautiful area in the crystal clear water of the South China Sea and
          decided it was time to rest. She gently lay down in the water,
          enjoying the freshness and the beauty of the sky, warming her body by
          the sun. She finally fell asleep, completely relaxed by the beautiful
          atmosphere. When she woke she noticed animals who took shelter on her
          flank. She noticed monkeys climbing on her body, colourful fish hiding
          among her legs and travellers relaxing on her belly. Charmed by this
          atmosphere she created, she suddenly realized she should not be
          enclosed within a palace, but could become a princess of the sea
          offering protection to everyone who needed it. Using her power, she
          dug her legs deep in the bottom of the ocean and they became rocks and
          corals. She deployed her wings around her and transformed them into a
          tree, covering her body with jungle. Finally, she gave a last look to
          the life growing around and on her, to the sea she loved so much and
          to the sky she would never cross again and transformed herself
          entirely into rocks. And Pulau Tioman was born.
